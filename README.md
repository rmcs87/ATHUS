ATHUS: A Framework for Games in the Ginga Middleware (SBTVD)
================================

This Framework is written in Lua + NCL, and its objetive is to easy the development of Ginga applications, in special, Game ones. It is the result of my Master Work, and will no longer be updated by me.

I will provide no documentation here, but interested people can find more info here: https://dtvgames.wordpress.com/

"Games are ancient tools of entertainment for humans, but also serve as tools for your intellectual growth. Games are also a way to overcome our limits, since they essentially have the character of a challenge. A game should give the player the ability to solve problems generated by the dynamics of the game. Thus we have a simple definition of play: the game is an activity of problem solving that provides fun. Due to its large capacity for games, it is important to explore the capabilities of games for the DTV, for that we present a propose of a generic framework for developing games that aims to facilitate the development of games for the Ginga, and other studies on games for DTV."
